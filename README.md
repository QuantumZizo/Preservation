# Preservation
Preservation is a mod for Minecraft which adds the feature of food spoilage and consequently preservation, upping the difficulty in a Vintage Story like style.

## Requirements
(Optional) [Cold Sweat](https://modrinth.com/mod/cold-sweat); While not required, Cold Sweat (with its temperature system) increases the accuracy of climate affecting the spoilage of food,
while also allowing you to see the actual ambient temperature in your area.

## Description
This mod adds the ability for foods, like fruits, vegetables, and meats, to spoil as they would in the real world, preventing you from simply throwing food in a chest and then forgetting.
Left improperly stored, these foods will decay completely into rot, which does nothing but serve as food for the composter.
Along with that, methods to keep your food fresh and nourishing are present, such as sealed containers, cellars, and the curing of meats.
If you're a Vintage Story player, you might recognize these features because they are inspired off of Vintage Story, and some parts are balanced similarly as well.

## Details
This mod is quite configurable via the config file, in that you can change the global spoilage rate or that of specific food groups.
Nothing needs to be done to add this mod to a modpack, please feel free to.
